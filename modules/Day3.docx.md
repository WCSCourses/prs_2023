## Key Learning Outcomes
After completing this practical, you should be able to:
  1. know how to adjust for ascertainment bias in case-control analysis
  2. Know how over-fitting aﬀects PRS results and how to handle it 
  3. understand distribution of PRS
  4. understand diﬀerent file formats involved in gene-set analysis
  5. understand diﬀerence between self-contained and competitive gene-set analyses
  6. Calculate pathway based PRS

## Resources you will be using 
To perform PRS analyses, summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are required. In this workshop, the following summary statistics are used:

|**Phenotype**|**Provider**|**Description**|**Download Link**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Height|[GIANT Consortium](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files)|GWAS of height on 253,288 individuals| [Link](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/images/0/01/GIANT_HEIGHT_Wood_et_al_2014_publicrelease_HapMapCeuFreq.txt.gz)|
|Coronary artery disease (CAD)|[CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium](http://www.cardiogramplusc4d.org/)|GWAS on 60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 controls| [Link](http://www.cardiogramplusc4d.org/media/cardiogramplusc4d-consortium/data-downloads/cad.additive.Oct2015.pub.zip)|

## Additional Resources

In this practical, we will explore how to perform gene-set based PRS analyses. To perform this analysis, gene-set information and coordinates for the genic regions are required. These information can be obtained from the following database:

|**Data Set**|**Description**|**Download Link**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Ensembl Human Genome GTF file|A file containing the coordinates for genes in the human genome. Used by PRSice to map the SNPs onto genic regions| [Link](https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-109/gtf/homo_sapiens/) |
|MSigDB Gene Sets | File containing the gene-set information. *Free registration required.*| [Download here after registration](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/download_file.jsp?filePath=/resources/msigdb/6.1/h.all.v6.1.symbols.gmt)|

## Exercise 1 Estimating R<sup>2</sup> in case and control studies
Bias in R<sup>2</sup> estimation caused by ascertained case/control samples can be adjusted using the equation proposed by Lee et al (2011), which requires the sample prevalence (case/control ratio) and population prevalence as parameters. This function is implemented in PRSice and the adjustment can be performed by providing the population prevalence to the command --prevalence.

Residuals of logistic regression is not well defined, and in PRS analyses, Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup> is usually used to represent the model R2 (this is the default of PRSice). However, this R2 does not account for the diﬀerence between sample prevalence (i.e. case-control ratio) and population prevalence, which can lead to bias in the reported R2 (Figure 1.1a).

Bias in R<sup>2</sup> estimation caused by ascertained case/control samples can be adjusted using the equation proposed by Lee et al. 2012 (Figure 1.1b), which requires the sample
prevalence (case/control ratio) and population prevalence as parameters. This function is implemented in PRSice and the adjustment can be performed by providing the population prevalence to the command --prevalence.

Now, account for the ascertainment of the case/control sample by including the population prevalence (let’s assume e.g. 5% here) in the PRSice command to obtain the adjusted (Lee) R<sup>2</sup> :

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
    --prsice Software/PRSice_linux \
    --base  Base_Data/cad.add.txt \
    --target Target_Data/TAR \
    --snp markername \
    --A1 effect_allele \
    --A2 noneffect_allele \
    --chr chr \
    --bp bp_hg19 \
    --stat beta \
    --beta \
    --pvalue p_dgc \
    --pheno Target_Data/TAR.cad \
    --prevalence 0.493 \
    --binary-target T \
--out Results/CAD.highres.LEER2
```
Check the *.summary file in the Results folder where you will find the usual (Nagelkerke) R<sup>2</sup> and the adjusted (Lee) R<sup>2</sup>.
